# Protocol Dissectors

## Overview

### Pyshark Dissectors (Recommended)

The [pyshark-dissectors](https://github.com/Skiti/Espoofer/tree/main/reverse-engineering/protocol-dissectors/pyshark-dissectors) folder contains our Pyshark script that automatically extracts Xiaomi packets from a BLE capture file, and analyzes their fields.

### Scapy Dissectors

The [scapy-dissectors](https://github.com/Skiti/Espoofer/tree/main/reverse-engineering/protocol-dissectors/scapy-dissectors) folder contains our Scapy script that analyzes the fields of Xiaomi packets. Use this if you want to analyze a small subset of packet, as it requires some manual work.
